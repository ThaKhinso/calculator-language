This is meant for typing out math equations so it should be simple
Like for example
12 + 33 * 8 / 9 << 4 >> 6

The language will evaluate the multiply sign and division signs first.
If there is an open, close bracket, the language will evaluate it first.

(12 + 33) * 8 / 9 << 4 >> 6

We will add the langauge features as the project progresses
